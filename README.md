# Glaucoma-and-non-Glaucoma-classification
 Overview
		Our project aims to assist individuals in detecting signs of glaucoma conveniently using a mobile phone camera. Glaucoma is a prevalent eye condition that often goes undetected 		until advanced stages. By leveraging a smartphone's camera and specialized lens, we provide a user-friendly platform for conducting preliminary eye examinations remotely.

 Features
		Mobile Eye Examination: Users can conduct eye examinations using their mobile phones equipped with a specific lens attachment.
		Glaucoma Detection: The system utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify images as either indicative of glaucoma or non-glaucoma.
		Convenience and Accessibility: By integrating with a website interface, users can easily access and utilize the examination tool from anywhere.
Objectives
		Develop a robust classification model to identify potential signs of glaucoma from captured images.
		Enable users to perform preliminary eye checks independently and remotely.
		Raise awareness about glaucoma and the importance of early detection through accessible technology.
		Technologies Used
	 	Data Collection: Gathered images of eyes for training and testing the classification models from some hospatal.
		Machine Learning: usig some machine learning algorezem like support vector machine ,Naive Bayes,Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classifier with some features 			extraction like hog and lbp
		Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized for more advanced image classification tasks.
		Web Development: A website interface is created to facilitate user interaction with the examination tool using flask app..
